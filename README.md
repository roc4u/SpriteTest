# SpriteTest
This is a little experiment with doing real time sprite generation I messed with a few years ago, decided to clean it up, set up a little test scenario and upload it here for others if they want to look at it.
There are no comments of worth so far, I hope to add some later, along with some info on how it works, but for now it's up here.
